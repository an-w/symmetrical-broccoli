Strategic use of technology in all sorts of businesses makes the difference between success and failure for these firms. Wealth creation is a real option for many and the business atmosphere is ready for you! Increasingly, people are seeing the advantages of doing their own thing, in their own way, in their own time. Entrepreneurs can control their own lives, structure their own progress and be accountable for their own success - they can fail, but they can not be fired! After all, engineers are the most capable people to be in the forefront of this drive to the business life of the next century. This course is the first of a series of two dealing with entrepreneurship and management of a small company. It is intended that the student would continue to take the follow up course APS432 as s/he progresses toward the engineering degree. Therefore, it is advisable that the descriptions of both courses be studied prior to deciding to take this one. This is a limited enrolment course. If the number of students electing to take the course exceeds the class size limit, selection of the final group will be made on the basis of the \"Entrepreneur's Test\". There will be a certificate awarded upon the successful completion of both courses attesting to the fact that the student has passed this Entrepreneurial Course Series at the University of Toronto. The course is based on real life issues, not theoretical developments or untried options. Topics covered include: Who is an entrepreneur; Canadian business environment; Acquisitions; Different business types (retail, wholesale, manufacturing, and services); Franchising; Human resources, Leadership, Business law; and many others. Several visitors are invited to provide the student with the opportunity to meet real entrepreneurs. There will be several assignments and a session project.

Learning frameworks and personal working styles inventories provide practical tools to assist the student to understand human nature and the logic of learning to become a competent leader of self, teams and organizations.  The student prepares to become a competent leader by undertaking to learn (understand and integrate) key skills, character attributes and purposeful behaviours.  The course presents strategies for development of high performance teams.  Special attention is given to a number of subjects: transformational change, organizational culture, high performance work systems, and self-leadership.  The course material is delivered through lectures, readings, in-class discussion and a team project.

It is designed to familiarise you with the kinds of opportunities (problems) likely to be encountered in an entrepreneurial career. If you really want this lifestyle and are prepared to work hard, we will provide you with the practical knowledge and technical skills required to pursue this kind of career. Topics covered in this course include: Marketing and Sales; Legal issues; Financing the business; Human Resources challenges, the Business Plan and many other issues. Note that the course material may be adjusted between the two courses as required. We recognize the value of communication skills in both the classroom and in project reports. In fact, we require that you learn how to present yourself in a business-like manner. As and when appropriate, outside visitors from the business community will join in and contribute to the class discussions. The course deals with practical concepts, actual past and current events and is presented from the point of view of someone who has \"done it all\". This means that what you hear is the real stuff. There will be several assignments and the preparation of a full Business Plan as the session project. It should be noted that the 5 hours per week would all be used for whatever is needed at the time, so tutorials will not normally happen as the calendar indicates them.\"","session":["Winter"],"prereqs":"TEP234H1","coreqs":"None","exclusions":"CHE488H1/CIV488H1/ECE488H1/MIE488H1/MSE488H1","weight":"0.5","aus":{"Math":0,"NS":0,"CS":57.6,"ES":0,"ED":0,"Total":57.6}},{"course":"TEP442H1","title":"Cognitive and Psychological Foundations of Effective Leadership (Formerly APS442H1)","description":"\"This course investigates the cognitive and psychological foundations of effective leadership. Students will explore current theories driving effective leadership practice including models of leadership, neurophysiological correlates of leadership and psychodynamic approaches to leadership. Students will learn and apply skills including mental modeling, decision-making, teamwork and self-evaluation techniques. This course is aimed at helping Engineering students to gain practical skills that will enhance their impact as leaders throughout their careers.\"","session":["Winter"],"prereqs":"None","coreqs":"None","exclusions":"None","weight":"0.5","aus":{"Math":0,"NS":0,"CS":38.4,"ES":0,"ED":0,"Total":38.4}},{"course":"TEP444H1","title":"Positive Psychology for Engineers (Formerly APS444H1)","description":"Many disciplines have explored happiness - philosophy, anthropology, psychology, sociology, neurobiology, film, art and literature - to name a few. Why not engineering? During the first part of the course we will play catch-up, examining the scholarly and creative ways that people have attempted to understand what makes for a happy life. Then we turn our attention to our own domain-expertise, applying engineering concepts like \"balance\", \"flow\", \"amplitude\", \"dynamic equilibrium\"\"momentum\" and others to explore the ways that your technical knowledge can contribute to a deep understanding of happiness. This course is designed to challenge you academically as we analyze texts from a variety of disciplines, but it is also designed to challenge you personally to explore happiness as it relates to yourself, your own personal development and your success and fulfillment as an engineer.","session":["Fall"],"prereqs":"None","coreqs":"None","exclusions":"None","weight":"","aus":{"Math":0,"NS":0,"CS":38.4,"ES":0,"ED":0,"Total":38.4}},{"course":"TEP445H1","title":"The Power of Story: Discovering Your Leadership Narrative (Formerly APS445H1)","description":"This course offers an introduction to relational, authentic and transformational leadership theory by focusing on narrative and the power of story telling. Students will practice story-telling techniques by learning about the mechanics of stories, improve their public speaking by engaging in regular storytelling practice, explore their personal history by reflecting on their identities, and develop critical thinking skills regarding the stories (meta-narratives) that surround us, particularly as they relate to engineering problems/ethics. This is a highly experiential course with a focus on reading, discussion, practice and reflection.","session":["Fall","Winter"],"prereqs":"None","coreqs":"None","exclusions":"None","weight":"","aus":{"Math":0,"NS":0,"CS":32,"ES":0,"ED":0,"Total":32}},{"course":"TEP447H1","title":"The Art of Ethical & Equitable Decision Making in Engineering (Formerly APS447H1)","description":"The primary objective of this course is to help engineering students navigate the ambiguous world of engineering ethics and equity using case studies drawn from the careers of Canadian engineers. In addition to being exposed to a range of ethical theories, the PEO code of ethics and the legal context of engineering ethics, students enrolled in this course will engage in ethical decision-making on a weekly basis.","session":["Fall","Winter"],"prereqs":"None","coreqs":"None","exclusions":"None","weight":"","aus":{"Math":0,"NS":0,"CS":38.4,"ES":0,"ED":0,"Total":38.4}},{"course":"TEP448H1","title":"System Mapping","description":"System mapping is a system thinking tool that is frequently used in fields such as public health and environmental policy to describe complex, multi-stakeholder problems. Students will apply system mapping techniques to describe complex problems with techical, social and environmental aspects. Students will explore fields outside of engineering that are critical to these challenges, including public policy, sociology, and law. Students will complete a team project to develop a system map of a complex problem. The emphasis will be on problem definition not problem solution, though it is expected that maps will point to potential paths for solution.","session":["Winter"],"prereqs":"None","coreqs":"None","exclusions":"None","weight":"","aus":{"Math":0,"NS":0,"CS":38.4,"ES":0,"ED":0,"Total":38.4}}]}
